I made the motion matching sample Multiplayer ready. I dont know the dedicated server stuff.

FEATURES:


Replicated vault, mantle etc... 

Replicated sounds. 

I changed the level a bit. 

I deleted the ECHO, Twinblast etc, just left the UE4, UE5 mannequins and the UEFN mannequin. For smaller file size.

CHANGED FILES:

CBP_SandboxCharacter (Event Graph), ABP_SandboxCharacter (Get AO Value function), BP_NotifyState_MontageBlendOut (i changed "Blend Out Conditions" input to "Force Blend Out"), DefaultLevel
